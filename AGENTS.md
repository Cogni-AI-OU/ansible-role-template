# AGENTS.md

Persistent single-source truth for autonomous agent behavior.

## Key Files & Context Injection

- Project overview & install: [README.md](README.md)
- Agent configuration & conventions: [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- Workflow navigation: [.tours/getting-started.tour](.tours/getting-started.tour)
- Latest org baseline: <https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.md>

Read and merge these when operating inside corresponding sub-directories (order = precedence):

- [`.github/AGENTS.md`](.github/AGENTS.md)
- Any `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md` in ancestor, then current directory tree

## Common Tasks

### Testing

Molecule and Ansible are installed via the project `Pipfile`, so run every command through `pipenv`
(they are not on `PATH`).

```bash
# Run Molecule tests
pipenv run molecule test

# Syntax check
pipenv run molecule syntax
```

#### Molecule Platforms

Molecule platform names are prefixed with the role name (`template-`), e.g.
`template-debian-latest`. Molecule's Docker driver names each container exactly
after its platform, so generic names such as `debian-latest` would collide with
concurrent Molecule runs of other roles.

### Sandboxed / firewalled environments

Molecule defaults work on GitHub Actions runners with direct internet access. In sandboxed or
firewalled environments (no outbound NAT on the default Docker bridge, or a resolver that returns
non-routable IPv6 addresses), opt in with these environment variables:

- `MOLECULE_DOCKER_NETWORK=host` - Docker network used for both containers and image builds.
  Required where the default bridge has no outbound NAT.
- `MOLECULE_DOCKER_FORCE_IPV4=true` - prefer IPv4 for DNS resolution inside containers. Required
  where the resolver returns IPv6 addresses that are not routable.
- `MOLECULE_XVFB_DISPLAY_BASE` - only applies to repos that run the xvfb role; ignored elsewhere.

```bash
# Sandboxed run with host networking and IPv4 DNS preference
MOLECULE_DOCKER_NETWORK=host MOLECULE_DOCKER_FORCE_IPV4=true pipenv run molecule test
```

### Updating Pre-commit Hooks

Run `pre-commit autoupdate`, then `pre-commit run -a`. Revert any hook that breaks and file an issue for it.

Known blockers (as of the 2026-09 update):

- `ansible-lint` v26.8.0 declares `language_version: python3.14`. Without a Python 3.14
  interpreter, either keep the ref pinned or override the hook with `language_version: python3`.
- `pre-commit-hooks` v6.0.0 removed `check-byte-order-marker`; replace it with
  `fix-byte-order-marker`.
- `markdownlint-cli` v0.49.1 needs node >= 22.20 (its dev dependency `ava@8`). If the hook pins
  `language_version: 22.14.0`, the env fails to install; pin markdownlint-cli or bump the pinned node.
- `ansible-lint` + `community.docker`: a stale, empty
  `.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/docker` directory shadows the real collection
  and causes `couldn't resolve module/action 'community.docker.docker_container'`. Remove it.
- `additional_dependencies` with a version range must use the block form
  (`- ansible-core>=2.16,<2.21`); the inline flow form splits on the comma into separate
  requirements, and the no-space form trips ansible-lint's `yaml[commas]` rule.

`pre-commit run -a` can also surface pre-existing failures (e.g. `yamlfix`/`black` reformatting,
`flake8` violations) unrelated to the ref bump; CI lints only changed files, so file these separately.

## Conventions

- Reference GitHub Actions by simple major version tags (e.g. `actions/checkout@v6`),
  not pinned patch versions (e.g. `@v6.1.0`), so minor/patch updates apply automatically.
